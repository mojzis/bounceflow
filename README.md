# BounceFlow - Prototype

A physics-based puzzle game where kids learn through play. Guide a bouncing ball with dynamically changing properties by manipulating the environment.

**[Play the game here!](https://mojzis.github.io/bounceflow/)**

## About

BounceFlow is a project designed to teach kids physics principles through playful experimentation. Eventually, the ball's properties (elasticity, weight, friction) might change dynamically over time, creating evolving puzzles that adapt as you solve them.
This repository is a prototype to see how / whether kids enjoy it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Controls

**Desktop:**
- **Left-click + drag** - Move surfaces
- **Right-click + drag** - Rotate surfaces
- **Spacebar** - Release the ball
- **R key** - Restart level

**Mobile:**
- **Tap + drag** - Move surfaces
- **Two-finger rotate** - Rotate surfaces (coming soon)
- **Play button** - Release the ball

## Current Prototype Features

- ✅ Interactive surfaces (drag and rotate)
- ✅ 15 test levels with increasing difficulty
- ✅ Visual feedback for property changes (color, trails)
- ✅ Target collection system
- ✅ Touch controls for mobile

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** - Modern build tool and dev server
- **Matter.js** - 2D physics engine
- **Canvas API** - Rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework overhead




## Next Steps

- [ ] Add mass and friction property changes
- [ ] Create more levels (World 1-6)
- [ ] Add sound effects and music
- [ ] Implement particle effects
- [ ] Add proper menus and UI polish
